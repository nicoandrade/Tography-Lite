* Create a Portfolio Page
First you have to create your posts with a featured image and create a new Category to use it as your Portfolio Category.
All posts with this category will be shown as portfolio items.
Once the category is created you have to select it as Portfolio Category in Admin Panel>>Appearance>>Customize>>Theme Options>>Portfolio Category.
Then create a new page and use the "Portfolio" page template under Page Attributes.

* Add images to a Portfolio item
For adding image to a portfolio item just create a gallery and add it to the post, the theme will do de rest.

* Theme Options
All theme options are in:
Admin Panel>>Appearance>>Customize>>Theme Options

* Social Menu
Using the social nav menu is just like using any other nav menu in WordPress. You just need to add custom links pointing to your social media profiles.

So, the first step would be to create a new menu under the “Appearance > Menus” screen in the WordPress admin. To add custom links to this menu, use the “Links” box. Just make a link to the social media profiles you want to display.

And, for the last part, be sure to select “Social” for the “Theme Location” before saving your menu.
